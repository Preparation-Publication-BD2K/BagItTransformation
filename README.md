# BagIt Transformation

This project develops techniques for extracting information from data in BagIt format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) to the structured representation required by upstream analysis within the KnowEnG center. This data is then published back into the BagIt format for publication. 

This project is funded via the NIH BD2K initiative.
